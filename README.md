# MLH Global Hack Week AI-ML Edition February Submissions

Welcome to our repository containing submissions for the MLH Global Hack Week AI-ML Edition February! Below, you'll find details about the three projects developed during the hackathon:

## Projects:

### 1. Email Spam Detector
- **Description**: This project aims to detect spam emails using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze the content of emails and classify them as spam or non-spam.
- **Technologies**: Python, scikit-learn, natural language processing (NLP), Streamlit, Pickle


### 2. Object Detection
- **Description**: The object detection project focuses on identifying and localizing objects within images or video streams. It utilizes deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) for accurate detection.
- **Technologies**: Python, YOLOv8, PyTorch


### 3. Movie Recommendation System
- **Description**: This project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history. It employs collaborative filtering algorithms and content-based filtering to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Streamlit, Pickle
